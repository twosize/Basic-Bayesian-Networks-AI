%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% What to turn in:
% 1. Submit a copy of your program on Canvas named HW3.txt.
%    The digital copy will be used in case the grader needs to 
%    run your program to verify that it works, and to determine 
%    the submission time if late.  Each student on a team should
%    submit a duplicate copy on Canvas under his/her own name.
% 2. Submit a copy of your SCREEN SHOTS on Canvas as
%    a .pdf, .doc, or .docx file. Turn in one document with all
%    screen shots. Do not use a phone to photograph the screen.
%    Use "print screen" (PrtSc) and paste into a document.
%    Eact student on a team should submit a copy on Canvas
%    under his/her own name.

% Problem: Use Bratko's BN interpreter in fig15_11_mod on Canvas.
% Build a Bayesian network like the one described in
% HW3-description-fa23.docx.  Then ask the user if the patient lives 
% in a high pollution area, smokes, coughs, and has a positive 
% x-ray.  Then use the BN to compute the probability that the
% patient has asthma or cancer and tell the user as in this
% dialog:
% Does the patient live in high pollution area? (y n):
% Does the patient smoke? (y n):
% Does the patient cough? (y n):
% Is the chest x-ray positive? (y n):
% Probability of asthma: 
% Probability of cancer:
% Therefore, ____ is the more likely cause.

% Edit this file - add your solution to the steps below.
% Make your solution readable using indentation and white
% space. Do not use a line length that will wrap when printed.
% To run this file, rename it with a .pl extension if your are
% using SWI Prolog, or the proper extension for whatever Prolog
% you are using - you may use any standard Prolog interpreter.

% Directives (must be at the top of your SWI Prolog program).
% Syntax may differ in other Prolog interpreters.

:- dynamic p/2.
:- dynamic p/3.

% Step 1:  Define the graph HERE using the syntax required by
% Bratko's BN interpreter.  Example: if there is an arc
% in the BN from node a to node b (a is the parent of b), say: 
% parent(a, b).    
% Note: Use lower case letters for nodes!!
parent(hp, a).
parent(s,ca).
parent(a,co).
parent(ca,co).
parent(ca,x).




% Step 2: Define the prior probabilities HERE
% in the syntax for Bratko's BN interpreter.
% Example: p(b, 0.001). % prior probability of b is 0.001
% Note: Use lower case "p" in step 2 and step 3!!
p(hp, 0.30).
p(s, 0.20).

% Step 3: Define the conditional probability tables HERE
% in the syntax for Bratko's BN interpreter.
% Note: the 1st argument is a node, the 2nd argument
% is a list of nodes or negated nodes, and the 3rd
% argument is the conditional probablity.
% Example syntax: 
% p(sensor, [burglary, not(lightning)], 0.9).
% Note: the above in mathematical notation is:
% P(sensor | burglary & -lightening) = 0.9

p(a, [hp], 0.7).
p(a, [not(hp)], 0.2).
p(ca, [s], 0.4).
p(ca, [not(s)], 0.1).
p(co, [a, ca], 0.9).
p(co, [not(a), ca], 0.4).
p(co, [a, not(ca)], 0.7).
p(co, [not(a), not(ca)], 0.2).
p(x, [ca], 0.9).
p(x, [not(ca)], 0.03).

% Step 4: Follow these instructions for running your HW3 
%   with my modification of Bratko's BN interpreter:
%   1. Copy fig15_11_mod.pl (my mod of Bratko's BN interpreter) 
%      from Canvas to your computer.
%   2. Start Prolog on your HW3 program. Before running your 
%      program, tell Prolog to consult fig15_11_mod.pl
%      (in SWI Prolog, you would use menu commands: File
%      menu -> Consult -> fig15_11_mod.pl)


% Step 5: Implement the dialog with the user here to
% call the BN with the values given by the user. Use
% the same questions as in the sample dialog below.
% It is not necessary to check for bad user input, 
% but it should work for any valid answers!
% Sample dialogue:
% :- go.
% Does the patient live in high pollution area? (y n):
% Does the patient smoke? (y n):
% Does the patient cough? (y n):
% Is the chest x-ray positive? (y n):
% Probability of asthma: ___  (output the probability)
% Probability of cancer: ___  (output the probability)
% Therefore, ____ is the more likely cause.
go :-
    ask('Does the patient live in a high pollution area? (y n):', hp, Pollution),
    ask('Does the patient smoke? (y n):', s, Smoke),
    ask('Does the patient cough? (y n):', co, Cough),
    ask('Is the chest x-ray positive? (y n):', x, Xray),
    
    Evidence = [Pollution,Smoke, Cough, Xray],
                             
    prob(a, Evidence, AsthmaProb),
    prob(ca, Evidence, CancerProb),
    
    format('Probability of asthma: ~w~n', [AsthmaProb]),
    format('Probability of cancer: ~w~n', [CancerProb]),
    
    determine_cause(AsthmaProb, CancerProb).

ask(Question, Node, Answer) :-
    writeln(Question),
    read_line_to_string(user_input, AnswerStr),
    string_lower(AnswerStr, LowerAnswer), 
    process_answer(LowerAnswer, Node, Answer).

process_answer("y", Node, Node).
process_answer("n", Node, not(Node)).

determine_cause(AsthmaProb, CancerProb) :-
    AsthmaProb > CancerProb,
    writeln('Therefore, asthma is the more likely cause.').

determine_cause(AsthmaProb, CancerProb) :-
    AsthmaProb =< CancerProb,
    writeln('Therefore, cancer is the more likely cause.').


% Give screen shots of the dialog for these user inputs:
% Pollution    	Smoke	Cough	X-ray
% y             y       y       y
% y             n       y       n
% n             y       y       y
% n             n       y       n
